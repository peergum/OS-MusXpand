<h4>What is MusXpand?</h4>

MusXpand is a recently launched music subscription service and social network for artists and fans.
It's probably quite different from anything else you know.

<h4>Let's get into more details...</h4>

<a name='free'></a><h5>I only like free stuff, so is this FREE?</h5>

No. MusXpand is NOT free, although using the site is.

Our idea is that if someone works on something, spends time, probably money, they should be paid when others enjoy the result.

You can build things for your friends and family, but would you spend your money on a hobby and just give its production to EVERYONE?  
Probably not. Would you go to work only to make your boss happy making the hot money, while you work for free? Probably not.  

Artists are no different from you. They want to build artworks and share with everyone, but they frequently want to make a living of it
and for that to be possible they need to get paid for the stuff they produce.
 
Many people think music has to be free. Sometimes, even artists distribute their music for free, believing someday someone will
pay for it. But people usually don't care much about what is free, because it has no value, eventually.

And if music had to be free, food, cars, houses, everything else would have to be free to, then.

So, on MusXpand, we try to help and educate people about giving back. And we're making it the most reasonable possible.

<a name='subscriptions'></a><h5>What are your subscriptions?</h5>

We also call them "true fanships". For the price, it's almost like buying a CD. Our subscriptions cost $15 and give you access
to ONE artist for a whole year. But you don't just get one CD. You get full access to this artist's stuff.

<a name='fullaccess'></a><h5>What do you mean by Full Access?</h5>

It means you get full access (listen, view, download...) to ALL the media the artist uplaoded on MusXpand. 

But that's not all: if the artist releases new stuff during your subscription period (one year), you get it as well.

And there's even more...

<a name='forever'></a><h5>Forever subscriptions?</h5>

Yes, that's correct. We offer subscriptions, per artist, forever and the price is not only decent, it's just plain crazy!

If you renew your subscription at the end of your first year, for an additional $15 (that's $30 total: $15 for the first
year and $15 for the renewal), you will get access to the subscribed artist forever: you will be able to access anything they uploaded
on MusXpand, and everything they will upload here in the future.

It doesn't make sense? Well, think better. Is it better for an artist to see their whole collection being spread around the world
for free or to get at least some $30 per fan (minus our commission) for fans who will probably stay fans forever and tell all their friends about the
great deal?

<a name='commission'></a><h5>How much does the artist really get?</h5>

Well, we try to be the nicest possible to our friends artists, and the commission we take only aims at making this service sustainable and the best possible.
That means we pay the bandwidth both the fans and the artists use to upload/download/listen the the media, we pay the hosting (storing gigabytes
of data is definitely not free...) and we need to pay the staff, some marketing and various business expenses to grow the site.

We estimated 20% would be sufficient, we hope to be right ;-)

So, for each subscription and renewal, the artist gets $12 and we get $3.

<a name='friendly'></a><h5>How friendly can be a site that has me paying for stuff?</h5>

Well, you pay for what you get: a lot of media, of course, but also a real fanship with the artists you like: you can access and comment
on their walls, you can leave them messages, you can even contribute videos, photos, etc... to them. You're building a friendship,
since for the artist you're no more an anomymous number in the crowd, but a fan with a name, a picture, etc...

Moreover, we strive to make the site the best we can, so any comment, suggestion, feedback, criticism is taken very seriously and
we'll always do our best to satisfy you and make you feel at home on MusXpand.

<h5>What is it?</h5>

We produced a small video for newcomers to understand better the great benefits behind the MusXpand formula. Take the time
to watch it, and share it with your friends, so that we can make a revolution in the way music is handled today, and start
enjoying the real artists out there that produce quality music with a soul, independently of any commercial hype.
