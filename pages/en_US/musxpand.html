<p>Welcome to a new concept in the Music Business: <b>MusXpand&trade;</b></p>
<h5>The Concept</h5>
<audio id='media_mxsound' src="{siteurl}/sounds/musxpand.mp3"></audio>
<p>Basically, MusXpand (pronouced <i>|'myouzik'spand|</i>
{playicon:mxsound}
 as in <i>Music Expand</i>) was created with the purpose to strengthen
the relationship between the fans and the artists.</p>
<p>In today's world, most music people hear is based on fashion and tendencies that are dictated
by the big labels, and money-based. It is often accessory if the music is good artistically, if it
conveys any form of emotion, of message, because the focus is mainly based on its danceability and
ability to reproduce successful commercial patterns. Likewise, if you can compose and play
something similar to the latest hits, then you'll be treated as a King of Music... That is: until
the fashion fades and something else comes in... As good as this vision may be for a certain
category of musicians who focus more on the Money than on the Art, it doesn't satisfy most of
the category who think of themselves as Artists, with an uppercase A as in Art.</p>
<p>At MusXpand, we concentrate on a stronger element: Fidelity. And this covers two cases:
the fan's fidelity to their favorite artists, and the artist's fidelity to its own style. And we
want to make this the most important part of Music.<p>
<h5>How?</h5>
<p>On many sites, people can listen to music for free. Although most people may find it great, the
most evident counterpart is that the artists don't get anything from that. One could argue this
may lead to more exposure, yet being exposed besides hundreds of thousands of other artists
with highly variable music quality is probably useless, and all the more when you got no fans
on-board. So it's generally a pure waste of time and inefficient marketing.</p>
<p>It's evident the days are gone when people went to music stores, listened to CDs and occasionally
bought some. Now, music is definitely an online business. So, relatively few people buy CDs, they
bought digital music instead. Yet, with piracy, even this business is going to decline. Fighting
against piracy, you just pass once more the idea that your music is just about the money.</p>
<p>At MusXpand we have a better idea: let's build real fanships! Let's put the fan close to the
artist. How we do that? We promote a kind of membership: if you like an artist, listening to more
than a few hits, if you like to keep yourself posted about tours, releases, public talks with your
favorite artists and don't want to miss any, then we have the perfect solution for you: subscriptions.</p>
<h5>What is a MusXpand subscription?</h5>
<p>A MusXpand subscription is like a membership fee to access one artist's private space. And you will
find in this space everything you'd like to find, that is: music, videos, pictures, lyrics, scores;
everything the artist produced that could go digital will be here.</p>
<p>Any subscription is limited to one artist only. People may want to fan several artists and get a
discount for that but that's not the way we think artists should be treated by their fans. We want the
fan-artist relationship to be based on trust and reciprocity: the fan pays his contribution to the
artist's work and the artist delivers their art. So being a fan of one particular artist shouldn't
allow you to get a discount on another artist: wouldn't the latter seem to be worth less?</p>
<p>Now, if you bring new people to become fans of an artist, then you may really please the artist and get
some benefits for it: you will earn credits, that you will be able to use toward another
fanship, and everyone will be happy with it.</p>
<h5>What types of subscriptions do you offer?</h5>
<p>We currently defined two types of subscription: FOY and FOFA.</p>
<p><dt>FOY: Fan One Year</dt>
<dd>For US${FOY}, this subscription entitles you to access the artist's past productions and new releases during
one year. Yes, you read well: ALL previous productions from that artist will be accessible for you
to download and appreciate comfortably at home. And all new productions, until the next birthdate
of your fanship, will be available as well, as soon as released by the artist. This will
possibly include demos, drafts, collaborative works besides official releases. And you will get
them first hand, before any commercial release, just because you're a REAL fan and the artist wants
to thank you for that trust you put in him or her.</dd>
<dt>FOFA: Fan Once Fan Always</dt>
<dd>If you renew your FOY subscription for an additional US${FOY}, you will automatically become a Fan FOREVER.
What this means is, you'll have an eternal access to your favorite artist's stuff, past, present and future. Sounds good?</dd>
</p>
<h5>What's the trick?</h5>
<p>There is none. It's a win-win strategy. The artists gains real fans and the fans get access to
the artists' work.</p>
<p>Some people may just think it's an opportunity to "steal" all of one artist's work for a basic
subscription fee. Well, we don't think so, for two reasons: if you really think about stealing music
or other digital products, then why would you even pay for it: you could probably find this on the
net with a minimal search... For a small fee, what the fan does is starting a lasting and trustful
relationship, based on a reciprocal present: money for the artist and stuff for you.</p>
<p>Some artist, on the other side, may think that's just releasing all their stuff for an indecent
price. Consider this: why would you sell later that which you haven't sold yet? Because you'll get famous? Well,
if you get famous, you might think about thanking your first fans, and that's what you're doing now.
So, don't consider the emotional price of a CD, a picture, a DVD. Consider the value of getting one
more fan, that will bring more and more and make your success grow continuously.</p>
<h5>What if I become a fan and the artist stops producing?</h5>
<p>We thought about that. The answer is simple, very simple. If the artist stops producing during
your one-year (FOY) subscription, you will just stop being a fan, along with all other fans, and this
artist will start losing credibility. Just tell me what artist would want that? Now, as far as
the you are concerned, you got access to ALL the artist's stuff for a minimal fee and during one
year... Wasn't the deal good after all? How much would you have spent to get all this paying for
each item?</p>
<p>Regarding the FOFA subscription, you should only renew your first subscription if you felt the artist kept
producing. Of course, if an artist released new media just before your renewal, you may not expect anything new in a
very short term, but still you'll have paid for anything new to be released in the future, so be patient...
</p>
<h5>The final word</h5>
<p>We hope you get the picture. We are doing our best to help the artists, while more than satisfying
their fans. Everyone will win in this model. The artist gains trustful fans and the fans showing
support to the artists.</p>
<p>Note that by subscribing to an artist, your help is immediate. When you pay your FOY subscription or renew to become a FOFA,
the money reaches the artist immediately.</p>
