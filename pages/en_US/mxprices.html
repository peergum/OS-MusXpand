[h4]What prices are these?[/h4]

On MusXpand, we don't sell media or downloads. We sell FANSHIP.

When you become a FAN from one artist, by subscribing to him or her, you gain <b>full access</b> to <b>all media</b> already released on MusXpand <b>by that artist</b>,
<u>for one year or forever</u>, and if they release NEW medias during that period, you also get <b>full access to these new releases</b>.

[h5]What do you mean by FULL access?[/h5]

By full access, we simply mean <b>you can listen or view the media online</b>, directly on MusXpand, and if you wish <b>you can also download the media</b> you like from this artist, to
check them quietly at home, at work and eventually load them into your favorite MP3 player.

[h5]What is the period I can access these medias?[/h5]

You can subscribe for <u>one year</u> (or "FOY": Fan One Year), or <u>forever</u> (or "FOFA": Fan Once, Fan Always).

You initially subscribe for <b>one-year (FOY)</b>, but if you don't renew your subscription,
<b>you will lose online access, after one full year from the date of the purchase</b>,
to the medias from the artist you subscribed to 
and of course <b>you won't get any future release anymore</b>, but <u>anything you downloaded is yours forever</u>.
If this is your choice, we logically recommend you download the medias from the artist your subscribed to.

The <b>"forever" subscription (FOFA)</b> happens as soon as you <b>renew your subscription</b>, yet from the second year on <b>you'll continue having access for free and forever to this artist and to any subsequent releases</b>.

[h5]Is there any global subscription to all artists on MusXpand?[/h5]

No. Simply because <b>global subscriptions don't make sense to the artists</b> for they are considered as "commodities" and not as individual and original artists. 

When you become a fan, you <b>show support</b> to and help ONE artist to <b>keep on producing new media and possibly live from their Art</b>. When you
subscribe to ANY artist for a monthly fee, like on Spotify for instance, you just act as a pure consumer and usually just follow the fashion,
the hype of the moment. This doesn't bring any chance to independent, low budget and non-commercial artists to get some visibility. 

So, <b>on MusXpand you show your taste and support to the musicians <u>you like</u></b>. You don't pay for what you judge crap, and you don't pay
for artists you don't like. <b>Your money goes where you want it to go</b>.

[h5]Access forever... Is that a good deal for artists, eventually?[/h5]

If you renew your subscription to one artist, <b>you're showing them the BEST support</b> they could hope. During these years and
any subsequent ones, as an true fan <b>you will probably help the artist by promoting their
work</b>, telling your friends, family, and letting the world know about such good music or art in general. So <u>you will help them make even
more fans</u>. You're like their street team of highly trusting individuals!

Many artists frequently think about selling tunes, singles or albums, because they need the money to keep on producing. Yet, at
MusXpand, we think artists will be much more successful if they think about friendship and not about merchandising. We think it's time for
the Music Business to enter it's 3.0 version, that is, to become a <b>producer/consumer <u>emotional</u> relationship</b> and not a way for a few
people to enjoy some "showbiz" life without giving any attention to the ones that made success possible in the first place, the fans.

[h5]And now?[/h5]

Now, take your time, register and visit our artists directory, listen to some extract, check out previews, and when you're decided about
who deserve your time, passion and money, go for it: subscribe!
