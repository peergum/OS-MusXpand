<h5>Congratulations</h5>
<p>So, you're decided! You want to be a fan, a true fan, a true supporter of
your favorite artist or band!</p>
<h5>And now...?</h5>
<p>The next step is logically to tell us what artist you want to support. As you know,
differently from what is usually seen our subscriptions or "fanships" are on a per-artist basis. Some may
argue that some sites allow you to listen to anything for a monthly fee. That's cool. But did
you question about how much each artist was earning with their system? Do you really think
your favorite will receive much of this money? And more importantly do you really want to pay
for the other artists, for some you don't even like, maybe hate? And last but not least: don't
you find these fees really high? Did you estimate how much you were finally paying,
on a yearly basis, for music you hardly listened to because you were not connected to the
Internet, for instance... Did you download any of your favorite songs? No? Why? Is it that
you can just listen to the music, but it is still not yours!?</p>
<h5>So...?</h5>
<p>So now you know the difference. MusXpand's difference is just that: you pay for music and
media you really own, and in the same time, you help the artist create, produce, mix and
do what they do best, music, thanks to your support.</p>
<h5>And...?</h5>
<p>And it's turn for you to choose your artists. To do that, you can either search for your
favorite artist in the Search box at the top of the page, then click on See Profile on their
picture, or you can go and look for them in the {menu:artists,artsdir}.</p>
