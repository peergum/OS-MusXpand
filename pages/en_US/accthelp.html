Welcome to the Accounts Help Section

All sites are different and all have different ways to handle members' accounts. At MusXpand
we tried to make it as easy and intuitive as possible, but we know what's intuitive for one
person may be counter-intuitive for another one. Everyone likes things their way...

So, this section is to be used as a Quick Guide to your account, and we hope to answer all
the questions you may have.

<h5>{menu:account,profile}</h5>

This option allows to setup your account and customize it. The layout is not yet definitive
and allows you currently to access and edit most information about you. To edit a section,
just click on the little pen besides it:

<dl><dt>Internal information</dt><dd>your IDs and status on MusXpand, Facebook,...</dd>
<dt>Picture</dt><dd>the picture that appears along with your profile. You can easily update it from
Facebook or by uploading a picture from your computer. Note that clicking on your profile
picture on the top left of the MusXpand page will bring you directly to this section.</dd>
<dt>Basic information</dt><dd>your names, gender, birthdate, and - optionally - artist name.</dd>
<dt>Location</dt><dd>you can setup your location and language information here.</dd>
<dt>Details</dt><dd>This is the place you can tell others a bit more about you: "about" line, little
biography, website...</dd>
<dt>Customization</dt><dd>this section enables you to change the background in MusXpand for your
account and the level of transparency of the page.</dd>
<dt>MusXpace</dt><dd>is a concept we're currently developing. Don't bother about it for now ;-)</dd>
<dt>Privacy</dt><dd>the privacy section is something we're proud of at MusXpand. Most of your data
can be setup as private or not, to various extents: you can share whatever about you with
whomever you want: friends, artists, fans, or everyone. Just make your choice... </dd>
<dt>Friends</dt><dd>- under construction -</dd>
<dt>Notifications</dt><dd>inform us which notifications you want to get or which you don't,
so that we never SPAM you with useless emails.</dd>
