[h4]Sales Terms and Conditions[/h4]

Buy purchasing on MusXpand you agree to be bound to the following terms.

<h5>"FOY" - "Fan One Year" Subscriptions</h5>

A FOY subscription is valid ("active") for a [b]one year' period[/b], starting on the date of purchase
and terminating at 11:59pm (GMT) on the previous day to the subscription's birthday. The FOY subscription entitles
the buyer to listen to and/or download [b]any media published [u]by the corresponding artist[/u] after the
subscription is activated and until it terminates[/b].

Because the buyer gets access to all material previously released by the artist on MusXpand at the
time of subscription, a [b]subscription to any particular artist can't be cancelled for
any reason[/b],[u]unless no media from that particular artist was either streamed or downloaded[/u] after the subscription's
activation. Any cancellation request will be processed diligently after the due verifications will be made.

All FOY subscriptions will be automatically renewed once, on their birthday, unless the buyer cancels the automatic renewal
from the user's subscriptions control panel. Any FOY renewal is automatically converted into a FOFA, which is NOT refundable, and will
give the buyer access to the corresponding artist's media forever.

If the buyer cancels the automatic renewal of her subscription, she will need to remember to renew the subscription any time
before or until 7 days
after its expiry. If the subscription is not renewed in the informed delay, the buyer will lose the benefit of converting her
FOY to a FOFA and any future subscription to the same artist will be considered a new FOY subscription, not a renewal. For 
simplicity reasons, we recommend users to leave enabled or to enable the autorenewal of their subscriptions.

If the buyer doesn't intend to renew her subscription, we nevertheless recommend her to download the media available in her
subscription before its expiry.

<h5>"FOFA" - "Fan Once Fan Always" Subscriptions</h5>

FOFA subscriptions are [b]equivalent in value to 2 FOY subscriptions[/b], yet
[b]the fan will continue to have access to any media from the particular artist he or she
became a fan of, [u]after the 2nd year of continuous subscription[/u][/b] and will not need to renew her subscription
after the second year.

If she pays anticipatedly the full value of the FOFA subscription, [b]the buyer can still convert her FOFA subscription
to a simple FOY subscription[/b] [u]BEFORE the first birthday of her subscription[/u]. She will then be reimbursed the difference
between the FOY and the FOFA subscriptions, and will lose access to the corresponding artist's media at the end of the
first subscription year, instead of getting access to that artist forever.

If a FOFA subscription was not purchased initially, but a FOY was purchased instead, any renewal made until 7 days after the FOY
subscription's expiry will be automatically converted into a FOFA and will not be refundable.

<h5>Monthly subscriptions</h5>

These subscriptions are activated as soon as the buyer's payment is confirmed, and automatically renewed every month on the same
day they were activated. A monthly subscription can be cancelled at any time, and a prorated refund will be generated. The
buyer can cancel the automatic renewal of her monthly subscription at any time, from the user's subscriptions panel, which will then
expire automatically at the end of the current period, without the need of any refund processing.
