<!-- <p>[b]MusXpand[/b] is currently being developed by {menu:about,phil}, and the development
started in September 2010, with the purpose of bringing artists
and fans closer together in the Music Business.
</p>
[h5]The Project and the Team[/h5]
<p>So far, MusXpand is a tiny project growing slowly. In addition to its unique developer at
the moment, it also counts on a few dynamic beta-testers on board and on a big network of
friends worldwide for suggestions, comments, critiques and, er... bug discoveries... See more
about the current {menu:help,mxversion}.
</p>
[h5]Nationality[/h5]
<p>Despite Phil's French nationality and the fact the site's development started in Brazil,
MusXpand has been launched as a Canadian Business in March 2011. Of course, as an online
business MusXpand aims at gathering artists and fans all around the world.
</p>
[h5]Financing[/h5]
<p>MusXpand is currently self-financed, and plans to stay so until things get to a point where
some external financing will be needed. Then, we'll be looking for partners... Or maybe
interested partners will be looking for us :-)
</p> -->
[h5]Our Mission[/h5]
<p>Our mission is simple: we want to help artists to build their fan base and get rewarded for
their hard work. On the other side, we also want the fans to be able to show real support to the
bands they like. In the best possible world, both objective would come to a common point,
where the artists could live happily bringing pleasure to their fans.
</p>
[h5]Our Vision[/h5]
<p>In 10 more years, the Music Business as we know it will probably have disappeared. The big labels
will probably keep on trying and making millions on the back of a few artists that people will
listen to for fashion reasons, but the true music and talents will definitely be in the hand
of the artists themselves, who will really care of their online and offline presence and consider
their fans more important than their money. Artists will compose and play music to
please their fans, not to become millionaires, and their fans will eventually help them being
successful.
