<div class="mx-message"><p>Bad News...</p>

Unfortunately, at this time MusXpand is only accepting new registrations through invites.
If a friend sent you an invitation, please use the link informed in the message to register.

We will fully open the site as soon as things are stable and no major issue appears. In the meantime, please
receive our apologies and be sure to check the site regularly if you don't get an invite through some of your friends.'

Sincerely,<br/>
Philippe Hilger,<br/>
Founder, MusXpand.
