The {menu:media,mystuff} menu allows artists to upload media, organise them into bundles and publish them.

<a name="start"></a><h5>Let's start!</h5>

The Media List form is made of 4 tabs:
<ul>
<li><b>New Media and Uploads</b> holds "unreleased" (unpublished) media that nobody can see, except yourself. You will use the
Upload button to send one or more media to the server; note the button also works as a drag and drop area, which makes it
really easy for you to upload files</li>
<li><b>Published</b> holds the media you have already "shared". You can share with everyone (<i>public</i>), that is:
unlogged people, with MusXpand <i>Members</i> (logged people), or with <i>Fans</i> only. As soon as you share one media, you
won't be able to unshare or delete it anymore, but you always can change it to Fans only. This comes from the fact your real fans
(subscribers) have acquired personal reproduction rights on the stuff you shared and deleting stuff would be like taking a CD away
from them... Yet you can archive some stuff, which will prevent <u>new</u> fans from seeing it, whilst old fans will continue to
have access to it (which is equivalent to stop selling a CD for instance)</li>
<li><b>Archived</b> holds the media you archived, as explained above. You can always republish archived media.</li>
<li><b>All Media</b> allows you to easily edit media and bundles information from one place, independent from their publication
status</li>
</ul>

<a name="uploading"></a><h5>Uploading Media</h5>

Uploading media is super-dooper easy. All you have to do is click on the upload button, choose one or more media to upload
(we handle currently pictures [JPG,PNG,GIF], audio [MP3], and some video [MOV,MPG,M4V,MP4] but we can't guarantee videos will play
on all browsers at this point...) and they will start uploading in parallel.

You can also simply drag a media from your computer and drop them onto the Upload button, which will automatically enlarge, and
your transfer will start. You can of course add more media while files are transferring. Maybe just go and have a coffee if your
connection is slow, because you should not leave the page until the transfer ends ;-)

When each transfer ends properly, you'll see a little green OK besides the file name and it will appear in the table below, but you
shouldn't be able to play it at that time. The media will be processed in background, to generate previews and a graphical
waveform for your tracks. As soon as all media get the OK sign, you can leave the page, the upload is done. 

When the media will be ready to access, it will appear in your "Miscellaneous" default system bundle (you can rename that bundle
if you wish, see how in the next sections). You should also see a play button besides it which will allow you to "play" it, that is
view it or listen to it. You can then edit the information about the media and, eventually, publish it.
{TOP}

<a name="editing"></a><h5>Editing the Media Details</h5>

If you want to change the media name (title), description, type (song, instrumental, picture, background,...) and completion state
(draft, demo, unfinished, extract, full version...), you just need to select the corresponding media(s) by checking the little box
on their side and click the Edit button.

A note on media types. At this point we mainly manage pictures and audio/video tracks. We will be working on text documents (PDF)
soon to allow people to upload lyrics, scores, letters, etc... A special category is "Backgrounds": these are pictures that you can use as a background for your artist page (and your subscribing
fans can use the same, lucky them!)
{TOP}

<a name="bundles"></a><h5>Creating and Editing Bundles</h5>

Bundles are like folders, or albums. We didn't use the term "album" because our bundles can hold any kind of media.

MusXpand handles bundles like virtual media. This means you can do the same things to them you would do on any other media:
change their name, description, state...

The first bundle you will see is "Miscellaneous". It is a special system bundle that you won't be able to remove, publish,
archive, etc... It is in fact in all these states in the same time: it can hold published stuff along with unreleased ones, and
you will see it in all sections.

To create a new regular bundle, fill the "Bundle Name" field and click on "Create a New Bundle". It should appear shortly after that.
You can only create bundles in the New Media section. Why would you create an empty published bundle anyway?
{TOP}

<a name="moving"></a><h5>Moving Media</h5>

You can move media around, change your mind if something fits better with one bundle than with another one.

To move media from one bundle to another, just select them (check the boxes), select the destination bundle in the list
beside the "Move to Bundle" button, and click the button.

You can also move the whole content of one or more bundles into another one: just select the origin bundle(s), select the
destination bundle in the list as above, and click the button. Note the bundle itself won't be moved but only its content, since
we don't handle sub-bundles at this time.

You also have to consider some limitations while moving media around, related to the state of publication of the media and
bundle themselves. We'll see that in the next chapter, about publishing.' 
 
Also note that, at this moment, any media can only appear in one bundle. We'll be allowing you shortly to copy media between the bundles.
The bundles, as we said, are purely virtual, and behave like "labels". So copying media between bundles will allow you to build
up compilation bundles in no time! And with no additional uploads, unless you want to add special versions of some media. 
{TOP}

<a name="associations"></a><h5>Associating Media</h5>

One nice thing with MusXpand is, you can associate one or more pictures (and soon, docs) to any media and bundle. Concretely, this
means you can substitute an album cover picture to the generic multimedia icon for a bundle, you can substitute a picture to the
generic media icon for any track and that picture will also display while the track's playing.

Better: you can already associate several pictures to a bundle or a track, and we're currently working on a slideshow system
that will play these pics alternately while the track plays...

How to do it? As usual, it's easy: just select the picture(s) you want to associate, the bundle(s) and/or media(s) you want to
associate them to, and click Link. Then all bundles and medias selected will have the selected pictures associated.

If you want separate pictures for each track, you'll have to do it one by one, of course.

Associating media is really easy and straightforward, and since it makes your account much more attractive, we really recommend
you do it.

<a name="publishing"></a><h5>Publishing Media</h5>

Publishing, or in other words <i>sharing</i>, is one of the most important decisions you will make on MusXpand. And it's so
important because there is no way back. If you publish something, it's like sending a CD to a store: you will hardly be able
to get it back without any sales being made...

We decided this way to protect the fans. No fan would like to subscribe to an artists offering tens of media one day, and the next
day all media would be gone. In the same time, this unability to delete media will allow us to track down any illegal publication
of copyrighted media by an artist who has no right to do it.

Nevertheless, artists still can archive their media, which will remove their access from any new or future fan, but will keep
the media accessible to current fans. We'll detail this in the next chapter.

You have to understand that publishing something doesn't mean you have to only produce finished version of your art.
You may want to publish intermediate works, drafts or demos of your productions, to get some feedback by your public.
You can always archive these initial medias when the final versions are ready to be released.

Enough with the theory, let's see how to publish.

So, to publish a bundle or a media is quite as easy as previous operations: you select them (check the box or boxes), and you
click publish. In the next screen, you will be able to edit the media details, if ever needed, and you'll inform whom you want
to share the media(s) with: Public, Members or Fans. When you publish a bundle, all media in it will get the same publishing
status (that is, public, members or fans).

There are some limitations about publishing you have to consider. You can publish both bundles and common media, but you have
to use common sense. For instance, a bundle and the media hold in it should be either published or unreleased, but not a mix
of it. You should avoid publishing media that belong an unpublished bundle, because these media might just get "invisible" to your
fans. Media within your "Work Bundle" can always be published, because that bundle has no share status, and the media in it
will become visible to people as soon as published.

Note that as soon as you publish a media, it will be fully visible by the category of people you decided and a preview will be
accessible by others UNLESS you restrict the bundle itself. For instance, a Fan-only bundle, even with public media in it, will
not be accessible by others than fans. If you want to make special media for fans exclusively, that's the way to do it. 

Our suggestion is to make bundles public, and files within them fans-only. You can be nice and allow non-fans to access full-size
pics and full-length tracks by sharing them with members (people registered on MusXpand) but we don't recommend making media
public, because that might not incite people to register and start becoming fans. And although you don't make the media public,
people from "outside" still can play a preview, which is probably enough for them to get a feeling of your art...

Also note that Public, Member-only or Fan-only bundles will appear in the corresponding sections of the Media global menu. So,
that's a good way to be discovered too...

When a media has been published, you can always modify its sharing status: just select it (in the Published tab), and click Edit.
In the next screen, just change the "State" to whatever group you want, edit the details if you want, and submit. You're done.

And don't forget: your work bundle is ALWAYS visible, but unreleased media in it won't appear to anyone else than you.

Wow! This part was dense. I suggest re-reading if you don't feel comfortable with all of it.

As a reminder, you can always know how your stuff appears to the public: just logout, and access http://www.musxpand.com/a/USERNAME
(substitute your username), then go to the media tab and you will see what unlogged people see. To see what members (non-fans) see
requires a separate fan account. Up to you to decide if you want to deal with two accounts. If you want to make your personal
life strictly separate from your artistic one, it may be a good option. Otherwise, don't forget an artist account can also become
fan of other artists so having a dedicated fan account is kind of useless...
{TOP}

<a name="archiving"></a><h5>Archiving Media</h5>

When a media has to be removed from sight, either because it was a temporary or unfinished version or because there was any
issue with it - preferably not a legal one! - it's the right time to archive it. As already explained, when you archive a media
(or bundle) they are removed access from everyone <u>except current fans</u>. The fans you have at the time of the archival
will continue to have access to the media until their subscription expires or 1 year after the archival, whichever occurs first.

This is interesting, because if you stop producing for instance and want to delete or disable your account, the media you
released will be archived and your existing fans will be able to access them for the above mentioned period. After that time
has passed, any archived media of yours will be definitely deleted.

Of course, if you have no fans at the time of archival, all media may be immediately deleted. (We're currently working on this
feature)

So, to archive any media or bundle, you do it the same way as usual: select them in the Published tab and click Archive. And
that's it...

<a name="issues"></a><h5>Common Issues...</h5>

In spite of our dedication to make things easy and user-friendly, we know the whole media publication process is not always
completely straight-forward. We tried to summarized hereafter a few common issues that were raised by our members...

<h6>Where's my bundle?</h6>

Although your Work Bundle (called 'Miscellaneous' if you didn't rename it) can be seen in the all 4 sections of the My Stuff page
the other bundles will only appear in 2 sections: all media and one of new, published and archived media, depending on its publication
status...

So if you publish a bundle, it will disappear from the New Media section and appear in Published. If you archive it, it will go
to the Archived section. Nothing really surprising in fact...

<h6>Where's my bundle? (2)</h6>

Yeah, of course you cannot transfer this newly uploaded media to your published bundle since he just disappeared from the New
Media section... So, if you already published an empty bundle for your latest album, well, you'll have to now publish the media
you want to move into it, and then move them to the bundle.

We may improve that soon by allowing moving unreleased (unpublished) stuff to a published bundle, and we'll then ask for a confirmation...
 
<h6>I can't move my media to the bundle I just created!</h6>

This is the opposite situation: you published some media, created a bundle, and now want to move those media to the new bundle.
However, you cannot move published media to an unpublished bundle, for evident reasons: that would subtract these media from your
fans, they would not be able to see them anymore...

So first you'll have to publish the new bundle, and then, within the Published section, move the media to the bundle.

Not so hard after all...

<h6>Why can I not delete or unpublish medias and bundles?</h6>

We have been thinking about this for a while. The reason is exclusively that you shouldn't take back what you gave to people.
When someone becomes one of your fans, and pays for this privileged relationship, he gets access to all the media you published.
If at some point you decide to unpublish some of the media (or all), then it would definitely not be fair to prevent your current
fans from accessing it anymore. It would be like taking the CD back from them...

Still, you can prevent NEW fans from seeing the media you had previously unpublished, and that's what we call "archiving". So,
whenever you think a media (or a bundle) has become obsolete, you can archive them and they won't be visible to anyone who
hadn't access to it. As far as current fans are concerned, they should be able to access these media until their subscription ends,
and they will also still be able to download these media.

If, later on, you decide to bring these medias or bundles back to the light, just re-publish them from the Archived section. 

<h6>I'm planning to delete my account on MusXpand. What will happen to my media?</h6>

Well, if you decide to delete your account, your current fans will continue to be able to access (and download) your media until
the end of their subscription, although your account will become invisible to other members. If fans became fans forever (5-year
subscription), they will also get a refund of the unused portion of their subscription.

As soon as no more fan is entitled access to your media, the media will be deleted, your account will be fully removed from
our systems, and your email will be banned from future use on MusXpand, to avoid any possible inconsistencies and abuses.

Just wondering, why would someone decide to desist from building a fanbase and monetize their art...? However, we know this is
a weird world... ;-)
