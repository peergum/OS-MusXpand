Yes it is. You can fully use the site and not pay us one dime. Then if you earn money, we'll take a commission from it to pay
for our expenses, which should be a good deal since we bring you the fans :-)

At this time, it's just 20%. Note the commission may be adjusted later on to reflect the site
growth and the corresponding expenses, but for now, each of your subscribers will earn you 80% of the subscription price.
