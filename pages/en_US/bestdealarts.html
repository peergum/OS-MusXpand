<h4>What use is MusXpand to Artists?</h4>

It's NOT. Our purpose is NOT just to show your Art and bring you hope you'll make fans and sell your CDs, singles or whatever.<br/>
Our goal is to <b>bring you fans AND money</b>, <u>through a transparent and trust-based relationship</u> between us, you and the fans.

<h4>Some more details</h4>

<h5>Subscription value</h5>

For 2011, the subscription for fans is US$15. So that's US$12 (80%) per fan of yours, one or twice, depending on the fan's renewal.

<h5>When do I get paid?</h5>

We will repay you the same month we get the payment from the fan, be it their initial subscription or its renewal.

<h5>Why do you keep 20% commission?</h5>

We need to pay for the site expenses (bandwidth, storage) and the staff and to allow the site's expansion, so we are definitely not stealing
from you, but trying to bring you the best service for the best price.

<h5>Can fans cancel a yearly subscription?</h5>

No they can't. Since they get instant access to ALL your stuff when they subscribe, there's no way back. They got the music, the deal is made. Exactly the
same as for CDs: if you opened the box, you cannot get a refund.

Note they can't cancel their subscription, but they can decide not to renew at the end of the first subscription year.
If they don't renew, they will lose access to all your stuff as soon as their yearly subscription ends.
But they will keep anything they downloaded during the year, since they paid for it.

Yet why wouldn't they renew, if you're good since they will then be able to listen to you until the end of times...

<h5>This FOREVER subscription doesn't sound like a good deal to me, artist...</h5>

We know these subscriptions forever may sound like a loss of money at first, but you have to think fans will love that, and any new fan will bring friends in,
and that will mean more subscriptions, and thus more money for you. Think SCALE, not small. If people like you, you'll earn much more this
way than any other way, trust us.

<h5>What prevents fans from downloading all my stuff and spread it around?</h5>

Nothing. But couldn't they do that somewhere else without paying anyway?

Our idea is, we can't fight against piracy without it becoming an annoyance for everyone, but you and us can make fans get a good deal
for their money and understand the benefits of contributing to an artist's production.

Whoever steals your stuff is not what we call a fan, and they probably don't even like your music. When people really like someone's music,
they are usually ready to help that artist in some way. And that's why you have to keep faithful to your style and not become another
number of today's ephemeral music. People steal things when they know they won't last. People buy things when they consider it an
investment.

<h5>Are my fans "captive"?</h5>

No. They can become fans of as many artists as they want to and afford.

<h5>How not to lose my fans?</h5>

When fans subscribe to you, it means they like your style, your music and your friendship, so keep up with that and don't sell your soul
to hype and fashion. It's more important to keep and grow your market niche than to try and reach millions - and possibly fail.
