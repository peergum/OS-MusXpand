<a name='isthisfree'></a><h5>Is this free?</h5>

You can open your account on MusXpand for free, and access most features of the site without any additional costs.
Some media may be available for free too, depending on what the artists decide, however, most artists' media is available 
through fanships.

<a name='whyshouldipay'></a><h5>Why should I pay?</h5>

You pay to help artists produce. Art can't be free: someone has to pay for it.

Would you work for free for your current employer? You might have a benevolent activity, which is a kind of hobby for you, but
you still need a full-time or part-time job to be able to pay for your expenses. Artists work the same. If they dedicate most
of their time to produce music, for instance, they need to earn something from it, because they also have to pay their bills.

When you download music for free, usually someone is paying for it: advertisers, sponsors, etc... Even google offers their
services for free because advertisers pay for that.

At MusXpand we decided that we would not let ads pollute the site, or influence anyhow the artists in their production.
We thought artists and fans could work together, as a trade relationship. Fans pay the artists to produce music, through
subscriptions or "fanships". And artists produce for them because they eventually can pay their bills.

So, why should you pay? Simply because you know your money will help your favorite artists and bands to keep on with their
good work.

<a name='soipayonce'></a><h5>So I pay once and can access everything?</h5> 

No. On MusXpand, differently to other sites, you don't pay for a membership. You pay for a fanship.

The difference? You help the artists you like. You become fan of your favorite artists.

So, the good point is you don't finance a bunch of lazy people, you finance people who deserve it. And you're the only judge.
If you think about it, it's not really different from buying a CD. Except that on MusXpand for the price you get MUCH MORE
than just a CD: you get a full fanship with access to all the artist's stuff.

<a name='doesallthemoney'></a><h5>Does all the fans' money go to the artists?</h5> 

Of course not. We couldn't do that, because to run the service we also have some bills to pay, and we decided that the
artists shouldn't have to pay to be able to expose their work. So we take a commission on all fanships, so that we can pay for all the
site's expenses, the staffs' salaries and the ability to have all this grow and become a reference in the Music Business.

Somehow, the artists end paying for it. Or you. Or both of you. But the artists do not have to have expenses BEFORE they earn
money, which would prevent many from surviving. It takes time to get a presence, build a fan base, and if the artist has to bear
many expenses before he even starts getting known, it can make things quite hard.

And honestly, we think the artists still get more than whatever they received before MusXpand: a lot of fans, great realtionships
and the feeling they are loved, eventually. And the fans gets so much that complaining would really being of bad faith ;-)

<a name='howhighcommission'></a><h5>How high is your commission?</h5>

At MusXpand we want transparency. We plan to publish the most we can legally about our costs and expenses, so that you can
see by yourself that we're not stealing from anyone. And we will probably offer the best remuneration to artists in the Music
Business, because our first goal is to help artists to produce and you to enjoy their work.
