<a name='fan'></a><h5>What is a MusXpand Fan?</h5>

A Fan on MusXpand is basically a music lover. After becoming a member, fans get access to more stuff, can share comments and opinions
about music and make friends.

However, what we call a True Fan on MusXpand, is when a member subscribes to one or several artists, really showing their fanship
and helping artists to produce. Yet, this is not just an artist funding and a way for artists to get some money to spend on anything. It's
more a way to start a special relationship between the artist and the fan, allowing artists to produce by subventioning their Art,
and getting some substantial benefits in return, inclusive an complete access to all the artist's production.

<a name='artist'></a><h5>What is a MusXpand Artist?</h5>

An Artist on MusXpand is of course also a music lover. A music lover who wants to share their Art with whomever likes it.
Our model of artists, the ones we love and cherrish, are the ones that can stay faithful to their ideas, feelings and art in
general. The ones who are conscious they may not please everyone, but still want to please the fans that have similar tastes.

By opening an account on MusXpand, the artists get access to Music Lovers who are looking for their kind of music. Music lovers
who are ready to pay and fund an artist when they fall in love with them.

Our artists are dedicated, and just need some support to be able to produce and maybe - who knows? - make a living of their Art.
On MusXpand, they just expect to share evrything they produce with THEIR fans, the ones who decided to put their TRUST in them.

<a name='whatchoose'></a><h5>So which one should I choose?</h5>

Well, if you produce music and plan to offer it to your possible fans, the best choice is probably to open an artist account.
Yet, if you're more interested in listening to music and become fan of other artists, then a fan account is definitely a better
choice.

You may also act as a fan with an artist account, that is become a fan of other artists, but in a much more limited way: a fan
can normally share its passion with friends and other members, having for instance their favorite artists backgrounds as the
background for their public profile; yet, an artist can only use their own background for their profile. Also, an artist needs
to be able to justify their professionalism, either by pertaining an artist association ("PRO") or showing us a proof of their
professional production.

If you really think you're as much a fan as an artist, our advice is to create two separata profiles, one under your personal
email and one under your artistic one. Then you'll enjoy the best of both worlds... And if privacy is an issue, it will definitely
be the best solution to keep your private and public lives separate.

<a name='soyoudontsell'></a><h5>So you don't sell Music?</h5>

Nope. We don't sell Music. At least not the way the music industry does. We don't sell a commodity. It's more like we sell fanship,
a strong and productive relationship between artists and fans. We sell hope. We sell the love of Music as an Art!

<a name='thisisnottheway'></a><h5>This is not the way the Music Business works...</h5>

No. We know about that. But the Music Business is dead anyway...
At MusXpand we prefer the concept of Music Lovers Networking. Something less focused on Money, and more on Art.
The Music Business with a Human Face if you prefer...

<a name='moreinvites'></a><h5>Can I get more invites?</h5>

We release the same number of invites per member. We may globally increase this number for everyone, but we won't do it on a
case by case basis. We recommend you send invites exclusively to the people you want to see on MusXpand at this time.

<a name='therewards'></a><h5>What about the rewards?</h5>

We'll work on rewarding people who bring members on, who in turn become fans, that is: paying subscribers. If you help in our
business expansion and success, why would we not reward you?

We'll define what rewards will be offered to users, as soon as possible, and these will probably be free fanships or discounts.
That is: WE will pay the artists for you and they'll get their money the same...
