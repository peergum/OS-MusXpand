<div class="mx-message"><p>Hey {firstname}!</p>
<p>We are really grateful for your interest in MusXpand and we are also certain you will
love the site the same way we love to build it up. For the moment the site is only open
to a restricted number of beta testers, whose main objective is to ensure the site is
usable and great for everyone, but we plan to expand our membership to people like you
who want to be part of MusXpand's success story.</p>
<p>As soon as we are ready to offer you the best service, we'll send you a personal e-mail
and invite you to visit again, so that you can enjoy the site and all its great features.
In the meantime, we apologize for leaving you in the wait but you ensure you that it will
be worth it!</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Philippe Hilger, Founder, MusXpand.</p></div>
