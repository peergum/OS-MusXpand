This initial version of MusXpand is dedicated to our dear friend, Chris, who passed away on the
23rd of November, 2010. 
Chris was one of our first beta-testers and a strong believer in MusXpand, as an alternative to
big labels and other music initiatives that usually focus more on the commercial profits of music
than on the relationship between artists and fans.
We deeply wish Chris was with us today to share the success of this new formula, and also use it
to share his great music. We'll miss you eternally.

[h5]Biography[/h5]
[p align=justify]
Christopher Quinn (born "Boy Talamantes", a half-breed adopted at the age of seven by a
big Irish cop named Frank) has been both greatly blessed and cursed. Like the Red King
dreaming universal realities, he seemed sometimes unbounded and unlimited in both creative
and physical abilities. Yet, like Alice with the Red Queen, life seemed to deal so many
uncertainties, that most days took all the running he could do just to stay in the same place.
[/p][p align=justify]
The photo displayed is from his early days as a young, popular, successful performing artist
in the L.A. area. He was once onstage with James Brown, toured with Sam Kinison, and shared
drinks with the visiting Rolling Stones, Graham Chapman, and Ringo Starr. His music career
was sidelined after a serious accident from which his health never recovered. Over the past
few years, the internet opened another door, thereby allowing him to work at home and share
thoughts, music, and ideas with musicians around the world. He had plans for at least three
more albums and was excited about the prospect of beginning again at the time of his unexpected
death.
[/p][p align=justify]
A fiercely independent bear of a man, Quinn remained a unique, some would say eccentric,
uncompromising individual in a world in which he was not always comfortable. To those who knew
him, the strength of his commitment to his ideals could only be dwarfed be his dedication to
his family and friends. He is and will be missed, apart from the prolific catalog of songs he
wrote over the years, often ghosted for others. The quality of that music, his music, and
instrumentation, recorded at home in his later years, under less than ideal circumstances,
proves that success is not always measured by fame or sales. His daughter's prayer is that,
like the Pheonix referred to in so many of his lyrics, may he rise from the ashes of his mortal
curse.

Quinn is survived by his wife Shabwawe, daughter Cecilia Rose (Christa), and two sons, Cody and
Cheyne. His last completed album, "End Of Time", may be purchased at
