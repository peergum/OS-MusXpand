[h4]Quick Summary[/h4]

We know <i>legalese</i> is quite annoying to read and decode, so we thought a quick summary of the legal terms,
in simple words, would be a good idea. Of course, this summary has absolutely no legal value since it might carry some
misunderstandings lawyers would certainly love to explore, and the only legal terms users bind to are the ones informed
in the next chapter ("Terms Of Use").

The basic idea behind this all is, MusXpand is mainly trying to be a nice site for all, based on the respect of laws and on good
relationships. Mostly, you should not infringe copyrights from artists and you should behave on the site, with respect for
others and others' work. Artists should only publish stuff they are entitled to (that is their own or whose rights to play
and distribute they acquired [inclusive for cover songs]) otherwise they will take FULL responsibility on any consequence of
it. If the artist releases any material involving a third-party, they should have their
legal agreement AND they will have to deal with repaying them all corresponding dues, and that will of course also include
part of our commission, since they will assume any third-party liability. Think about it. Make it simple: only use your OWN
stuff.

MusXpand only requires a royalties-free license to use artists' medias to be able to show/play them on the site to their fans
or to others as extracts, as decided by the artists themselves, and will NOT make any use of these medias outside of MusXpand.
The only money MusXpand makes from artists' works is through our commission, and this is used to pay for the various expenses
incured by the business. We are a fair enterprise and we have ethics. And so should you.

Now, you still can read the details below if you're up to it ;-)

 such registrations, services or products, these Terms of Use will prevail.

information. If you create a user account, you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your 
account or password, if any, and agree you will not sell, transfer or assign your user account. You are responsible for

subscriptions if you are considered capable of entering into an enforceable contract in the applicable jurisdiction. You

governed by a separate set of terms and conditions. A link to these terms and conditions will be found on the Website, 
alongside details of the specific competition, promotion, prize draw and other opportunities. It is your responsibility to 
read those terms and conditions for details about the terms that shall apply and any eligibility requirements.

<a name="software"><h5>9. Software</h5></a>

Any software that we make available for download or use from the Website and/or our servers (the "Software") is the 
intellectual property of MusXpand or its licensors or suppliers. Any such "Software" shall be considered a "Service" or

of an end user licence agreement that may accompany or that may be included with the Software (the "Licence Agreement"). 
Please carefully read any Licence Agreement and Paragraph 7 above to determine the full extent of the terms and conditions 
governing the use of such Software.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, COPYING OR REPRODUCTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ANY OTHER SERVER OR LOCATION FOR FURTHER USE, 
REPRODUCTION, REDISTRIBUTION OR OTHER EXPLOITATION IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED, UNLESS SUCH USE, REPRODUCTION, REDISTRIBUTION 
OR EXPLOITATION IS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THE LICENCE AGREEMENT APPLICABLE TO SUCH SOFTWARE.

<a name="copyrights"><h5>10. Copyrights and Copyright Agents</h5></a>

At MusXpand, we aim to respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work (or the work of a 
third party on whose behalf you are entitled to act) has been copied, used, or made available on or through the MusXpand 
Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement of your intellectual property, please provide our copyright agent 
with a copyright infringement notice ("Notice") which should include the following written information:

a statement that you have identified material on the Website which infringes your copyright (or infringes the copyright of 
a third party on whose behalf you are entitled to act, if applicable);

site are covered by a single Notice, a representative list of such works at that site;
identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to 
be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit MusXpand to locate the 
material (including, for example, a URL and/or screen shot);
your full name, email address, postal address and telephone number on which you can be contacted;
a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised 
by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
a statement by you that the information in the Notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party
 is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; and

outdated information and inadequacies and that the Content may be subject to terms and conditions, which may be found on

may permit third party users to upload content, in which event you, at your own risk, may be exposed to offensive, indecent 
or objectionable content.

Descriptions of, or references to, products, services or publications within the Website do not imply endorsement of 
that product, service or publication.

<a name="yourinfo"><h5>12. Information You Submit</h5></a>

From time to time, the Properties may contain functionality through which you can upload or submit information, data, 
software, messages, photographs, audio, video, text and other materials to, through or on the Website ("Your Upload 
Information"). For example, the Website may offer forums, bulletin boards, wikis, chat rooms, blogs or other interactive 
areas ("User Forums"). MusXpand, its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates or the directors, officers, employees, or other 
representatives of each of them do not endorse the content posted in User Forums. MusXpand reserves the right, but is not 
obligated, to delete, move or edit Your Upload Information, in whole or in part, submitted by you to a User Forum for any 
reason in their sole discretion. MusXpand reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Website and pursue 
all legal remedies if we believe your Upload Information infringes another's rights or otherwise violates any law, rule 
or regulation. You acknowledge and agree that you are prohibited from accepting payment for Your Upload Information from 
any third party, including, without limitation, accepting payment for the inclusion of a logo, brand advertising or other 
commercial content, in Your Upload Information.

All of Your Upload Information is your sole responsibility. This means that you, and not MusXpand, are entirely responsible 
for all of Your Upload Information that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available via the Website. 
MusXpand actively discourages you from uploading information or content (including photographs) about your friends or 
other people without their express prior consent. If you post personal information in User Forums or on other publicly 
available areas of the Website, then you may receive unsolicited messages from third parties. MusXpand cannot ensure the 
security of any information you post in User Forums or on publicly available areas of the Website. Under no circumstances 
will MusXpand be liable in any way for any of Your Upload Information including, but not limited to, any errors or 
omissions in Your Upload Information, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of Your Upload Information.

You warrant and represent that Your Upload Information: (i) is an original work by you or you have all necessary rights, 
licenses and permissions in it and to submit it to MusXpand under the terms of these Terms of Use; (ii) is not defamatory; 
and (iii) does not infringe upon, misappropriate or violate the rights of any third parties, including, without limitation, 
any intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy or any other proprietary rights or otherwise violate any 
law, rule, or regulation.

Except as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy or other agreement on the Website at which you provide Your Upload 
Information, Your Upload Information will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable 
for any use or disclosure to anyone, including but not limited to claimed intellectual property owners. When you upload 
Your Upload Information via the Website, you irrevocably grant to MusXpand, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and 
partners, without any credit or compensation to you, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, unrestricted, irrevocable, 
royalty-free and fully transferable, assignable and sub-licensable right and licence to use, reuse, modify, adapt, alter, 
display, archive, publish, sub-license, perform, copy, reproduce, disclose, transmit, communicate to the public, post, 
sell, translate, create derivative works of, distribute, make and export Your Upload Information (in whole or in part), 
or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now known or developed in the 
future, for any purposes whatsoever including, without limitation, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional 
purposes, such as developing, manufacturing and marketing products and targeted advertisements using such Uploaded 
Information. You hereby waive any moral rights (or any similar rights in any jurisdiction) you may have in and to any 
of Your Upload Information, even if such material is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. You agree 
and understand that MusXpand, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners are not obligated to use Your Upload 
Information submitted through the Website or otherwise, and may alternatively choose, in its sole discretion, to discard, 
refuse to post, limit or block access to Your Uploaded Information without any liability whatsoever.

You acknowledge that the Web Site, through MusXpand, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners undertakes no 
obligation to pre-screen Your Upload Information, but that it has the right, in its sole discretion to monitor, modify, 
transmit over various networks, refuse, move, block access to or remove any of Your Upload Information. You agree that 
you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any of Your Upload Information including, but not limited 
to, any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of Your Upload Information. Since MusXpand, its parent, 
subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners may not pre-screen user generated content, you may bear legal responsibility for 
others' exposure to any offensive indecent or objectionable content in Your Upload Information.
