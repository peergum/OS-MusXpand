<h5>More about Account Types</h5>

If you don't produce any media yourself and you are not related to any artist as a manager or label for instance, your best
account option is FAN. As a fan, you can share your tastes and opinions with other fans, become a fan of your favorite artists
and bands, get access to media and do whatever a fan would do. You will also be able to collaborate with your favorite
artists and will be allowed to brand your fan page with their pictures, logos, backgrounds, etc... In summary, you'll totally
live your fanship!

On the other side, if you need to share your productions with fans, promote your art, chat with your fans and do whatever an
artist would do, then you should choose an ARTIST profile, so that people can become your fans. Naturally, you'll have to provide
your own backgrounds, pictures and everything else to share with your public. Note that to avoid abuses and illegal sharing of
copyrighted media, we ask our artists to produce an official ID and a proof of registry with a PRO association (an artist
association where artists use to register their work). Until you show us the proof you really have the rights on the media you
will publish on MusXpand your artist account will be limited and won't even have all the benefits of a fan account. So, be wise.

If you're a band, you can use a collective account to manage the band, which is called a band account, and it will work under
the same conditions as an artist account. To make things simpler, we give the opportunity to artists to create and manage a
separate band account from their own artist account, so we suggest you just do that instead of having several people access a
band account directly.

If you're an artist or band manager or a label, well you'll be able to manage artists and bands, but we will ask you some legal
proofs of your relationship with the latters. (These accounts are not operational for now and just act as fan accounts.)
