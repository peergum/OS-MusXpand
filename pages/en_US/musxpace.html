<p>Welcome to the MusXpace section.</p>
<p>You may wonder: <b>what exactly is MusXpace?</b> MusXpace is a <b>new music world concept</b>,
where geography is reinvented, based on the following principles:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Music Universe</dt>
<dd><ul><li>An <b>open space</b> (there is nothing like a sphere called Earth in it)
</li><li>Populated with <b>Archipelagoes</b>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Archipelago</dt>
<dd><ul><li>Generally belongs to an artist or a band
<li>A few archipelagoes are publicly owned.
<li>Composed of <b>Islands</b>
<li>Open or closed. If it's open, then new Islands can be created;
if it's closed, then it's not geographically expansible.
</ul></dd>
<dt>Island</dt>
<dd><ul><li>Limited number, defined by its founder.
<li>Populated by fans and artists
<li>Organized into cities
<li>Populational limit, defined by the Island's creator. 
<li>Exclusively open to official fans of the owner band or artist.
<li>A fan can move to any existing Island in an artist's or band's Archipelago,
if it's not yet full
<li>If the Archipelago's owner authorized it, fans can create their own Island,
<u>within the predefined Islands number</u>.
<li>Everybody's first home in the Music Universe is on an Virtual Island called <i>Nowhere Island</i> within the
<i>Middle of the Sea</i>Virtual Archipelago. These do not really exist in the Universe and are
like a ghost area that doesn't appear on the <b>MusXpace Map</b>. However,
<u>people still can move to some Islands on a few real public Archipelagoes, if they prefer</u>.
