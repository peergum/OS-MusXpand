This Agreement was last updated on 1st June 2011.

THE MAIN TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT IN A NUTSHELL:

1.         You confirm that you have permission to upload all of your content and make it available worldwide (without restriction) or have obtained permission from the relevant rightsholder(s).

2.          Last.fm may (but shall have no obligation to) use your tracks for its Internet radio streaming service and for 30 second previews, and if you choose, for “full length promo” and / or “free downloads”, worldwide.

3.          During the registration process, you were given the option to share in royalties from the use of sound recordings of your tracks on the Last.fm services.

5.             RIGHTS IN THE CONTENT

5.1           Last.fm enters into licence arrangements with collection societies who administer music publishing rights. In order to be paid any royalties due to You under this Agreement for the use of any musical compositions in Your Content, You should join Your local collection society and register Your Content with them.

5.2           During the Music Manager registration process, You were asked to select one of three options dependent on who owns the rights in any sound recordings within Your Content. The option You selected determines how royalties will be paid for the exploitation of Your Content, as further explained below:

-           BOX 1: - I want to collect radio royalties for all my songs directly.

By selecting BOX 1:

(a)        You confirm that You wish to participate in Last.fm’s royalty share scheme;

(b)        You warrant to Last.fm that as of the date when You tick BOX 1, You are not a member of any collection society established for the collection of royalties for the communication to the public of sound recordings (for example, PPL in the UK or SoundExchange in the US); and

(c)        You agree that if You become a member of such a collection society, sign a deal with a record label or assign the rights in Your Content to a third party, You will immediately inform Last.fm by accessing your account and selecting Box 2. You must also provide Last.fm with all relevant details of Your membership with any collection society.

-           BOX 2: – I’m ineligible to collect royalties directly. I’m a member of a collection society for radio use.

By selecting BOX 2:

(a)        You confirm that You wish to participate in Last.fm’s royalty share scheme;

(b)        You warrant to Last.fm that as of the date when You tick BOX 2, You are a member of a collection society solely for the collection of royalties for the communication to the public of sound recordings on the radio (for example, PPL in the UK or SoundExchange in the US); and

(c)        You will provide Last.fm with all relevant information reasonably required by Last.fm for reporting radio usage of Your Content to such collection society.

-           BOX 3: – I don’t want to collect royalties or have entered into a direct royalty agreement with Last.fm.

By selecting BOX 3:

(a)        You confirm that as of the date when You tick BOX 3, You are not a member of a collection society for the collection of royalties for the communication to the public of sound recordings; and

(b)        You confirm that You do not wish to participate in Last.fm’s royalty scheme; or

(c)        You have entered into a direct royalty agreement with Last.fm, in which case the terms of such royalty agreement shall govern the way in which royalties accrue and are paid to You.

5.3           You agree that the acceptance by Last.fm of Your Content for inclusion on the Last.fm services and the payment of any royalty (where applicable) represents the entire and satisfactory consideration for the grant of the licence at clause 1.1 above.

5.4           If, for any reason, You need to change how royalties are paid for the use of Your Content on the Last.fm services, You can do so by logging on to Your label account and clicking on the ‘Royalties’ tab. Any change will only become effective from the date on which You make the change to Your label account.

5.5           If You have a direct royalty agreement with Last.fm, regardless of which option You selected during the registration process, the terms of such direct royalty agreement shall apply. Royalties will accrue and be payable in accordance with the terms of Your direct royalty agreement. If there is any conflict between the provisions of Your direct royalty agreement and this Agreement, the terms of Your direct royalty agreement with Last.fm shall take precedence.

6.             INDEMNITY

You hereby indemnify and will at all times keep Last.fm its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including CBS Corporation and its direct and indirect subsidiaries) fully and effectively indemnified from and against any and costs, claims, demands, investigations, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses whatsoever, including attorneys' fees arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, made against or incurred by Last.fm in consequence of any actual or alleged breach or non-performance by You of any of Your representations, warranties, undertakings  or covenants, or Your violation of any material term or condition, contained in this Agreement. You will cooperate as fully and reasonably as required by Last.fm in the defence of any claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Last.fm retains the exclusive right to settle, compromise and pay any and all claims, demands, proceedings, suits, actions or causes of actions which are brought against Last.fm.

7.             ROYALTY SHARE

7.1           Subject to clause 7.3, Last.fm will pay You royalties from making Your Content available on the Last.fm services. If You ticked BOX 1 or BOX 2, You are eligible to take part in the royalty scheme.

7.2           If You ticked BOX 2, royalties will be paid to the applicable collection society, the details of which You must provide to Last.fm.

7.3           If You ticked BOX 3, You have granted Last.fm a royalty-free licence pursuant to clause 1.1 above (unless You have entered into a direct royalty agreement with Last.fm as described in paragraph (c) under the Box 3 terms above). This means that Last.fm will be able to use Your Content without direct payment to You or payment to the applicable collection society unless and until You either:

(a)   terminate this Agreement by removing Your Content using the facility provided by the Last.fm services; or

(b)   become a member of an applicable collection society, in which case You must immediately inform Last.fm by logging on to Your label account and selecting Box 2 and provide all relevant details of Your membership.

You should not select BOX 1 if You are a member of a collection society for the collection of royalties (such as the PPL in the UK or SoundExchange in the US) for radio use of sound recordings because in those circumstances, Last.fm will pay the relevant royalties set out below to the relevant collection society. You must provide details of the collection society to Last.fm.

7.4          Last.fm shall pay the following royalties in respect of the streaming of Your Content as permitted by You:

-     for the free radio service, 10% of the Share of Last.fm’s Net Revenue from the free radio service.

-     for the subscription radio service, the greater of 20% of the Share of Last.fm’s Net Revenue from the subscription radio service or a per minima amount of US $0.0005 for each complete playback to an end user on the Last.fm subscription radio service of a track which forms part of Your Content.

In this section:

“Share” means a share of the Net Revenue royalty pool which is calculated by dividing the number of times a track which forms part of Your Content is played back to the end user by the total number of complete performances of sound recordings on the Last.fm services and multiplying that figure by the Net Revenue;

For the free radio service, “Net Revenue” means all advertising revenue (including sponsorship revenue but excluding subscription revenue), directly attributable to the actual playback of Your Content to a user through Last.fm services (including through affiliated sites and outlets) after the deduction of any advertising agency commissions paid to advertising agencies, sales houses or re-sellers.

For the subscription radio service, “Net Revenue” means the subscription fee paid by a user and received by Last.fm on all pages of the Last.fm Website where a user has accessed ad-free playback of Your Content through through Last.fm services (including through affiliated sites and outlets) after the deduction of any advertising agency commissions paid to advertising agencies, sales houses or re-sellers. All and any trial periods which Last.fm may grant to its users from time to time shall be treated as part of the free radio service for the purposes of this Agreement.

7.5        You expressly acknowledge and agree that no royalty shall be payable by Last.fm to You or any third party for preview clips, “full length promos”, “free downloads”, any streams of Your Content that are less than 30 seconds in length or for Your Content which is cached (and not played back to the end user), or for any metadata, artwork, images, lyrics, sleeve notes or other similar material provided by You.

7.6        Where Last.fm discovers a duplicate item of Your Content, Last.fm shall only be liable to pay a royalty to the party who is legally authorised to grant a licence to Last.fm. If You believe someone has uploaded your tracks to the Last.fm services without Your consent, You may notify Last.fm by following the procedure set out in the Last.fm Website Terms of Use and Last.fm will act in accordance with such procedure.

7.7        Royalties shall only start to accrue from the date on which Your Content is first used on the Last.fm Services provided that You have accepted these Terms and Conditions. Last.fm shall not be liable to You or any third party for any retrospective use of Your Content on the Last.fm services or for any royalties that are or have been incorrectly paid by Last.fm to any third party who claimed ownership of Your Content.

7.8        The minimum royalty amount payable pursuant to Clause 7.9 is either US$10.00, £5.00, €7.00 or ¥1000 depending on your local currency (the “Minimum Royalty”). Where the royalty payable to You in any given quarter does not amount to the Minimum Royalty, the sums due to You shall accrue until the amount owing is at least the Minimum Royalty. 

7.9        Where Last.fm is paying royalties directly to You, payments shall only be made following a written request from You via the Music Manager system and shall be made to the person identified as the nominated payee in Your label account on the date that You request the payment to be made (the “Nominated Payee”). Payments shall be made 30 days after the end of each quarter via a payment method chosen by Last.fm in its sole discretion and provided that the Minimum Royalty has been met.

7.10      Last.fm shall have discharged its obligation to pay royalties pursuant to clause 7.9 by paying the amount to the Nominated Payee. Last.fm shall have no further liability in this regard. It is Your responsibility to make sure that the Nominated Payee details are correct.

7.11      You can use royalties that have accrued to You to purchase Last.fm products to promote Your Content on the Last.fm services at any time, even where the amount accrued is less than the Minimum Royalty.

7.12      Payments shall be converted from US dollars to Your local currency at the spot rate on the last date of the relevant quarter before payment is made.

7.13      You shall be able to access information online via the Music Manager system detailing how many times Your Content is played and any royalty payments due to You. This information will be updated by Last.fm once every three months (in April, July, October and January) or as soon as is reasonably practicable.

7.14      If this Agreement is terminated by You or Last.fm for any reason, any royalties equal to or above the Minimum Royalty owing to You shall be paid in full 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which the Agreement is terminated to the Nominated Payee. Any royalties owing to You that are less than the Minimum Royalty shall be credited to You for the purchase of Last.fm products on the Last.fm services. 


8.          FULL LENGTH PROMOS, FREE DOWNLOADS AND PODCASTS

8.1        Last.fm gives You the opportunity to make Your Content available as “full length promos” and/or “free downloads” (to the extent available) on the Last.fm services. Where You choose to make Your Content available as “full length promos” and/or “free downloads”:

You further agree that you have cleared all rights (including in the form of waivers of all moral rights, neighbouring rights or similar rights held anywhere in the world) for the exploitation of such “full length promos” and/or “free downloads” and/or podcasts as set out in this Agreement.

(c)        in addition to the warranties set out in clause 4, You represent, warrant and undertake to Last.fm that:
