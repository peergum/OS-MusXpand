<h5>Why Invites? Is MusXpand not open?</h5>

Yes, it is. But we would love you to help us grow, so we built a system that will ease you the task of inviting friends or
fellow artists on board.

<h5>OK, but why would I do that?</h5>

Hey, we know this is promotion, and promotion is never free. So we built a referral system along with the Invites.

<h5>A referral system? Cool. But I still don't get what my gain is...</h5>

Well, each referree of yours will bring you Rewards Points (called "MXPs"), which in turn you will be able to convert into subscriptions.

<h5>How do I earn MXPs and how much?</h5>

The following table summarizes it all:
<table class="rewards">
<tr><th>For</th><th>You will get</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Every 100 invitees of yours</b><br/>who <b><u>fully</u> register</b> on MusXpand</td><td><b>1 MXP</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Every invitee of yours who subscribes<br/>or renews for <b>1-year to ONE artist</b></td><td><b>1 MXP</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Every invitee of yours who subscribes<br/>or renews for <b>1-year to TEN artists</b></td><td><b>1 additional MXP</b></td></tr>
</table>

<h5>What are the Rewards?</h5>

You can use your MXPs toward subscriptions on MusXpand:
<table class="rewards">
<tr><th>For</th><th>You will get</th><th>Value<span class="mandatory"><sup>*</sup></span></th></tr>
<tr><td><b>100 MXPs</b></td><td><b>ONE 1-year subscription or renewal</b></td><td><b>US$15</b></td></tr>

<h5>Hell!!! Where do I sign? :-D</h5>

Well, just start inviting your friends... And May the Force be with you, Luke! :-)
