[h5]Once Upon A Time...[/h5]
<p>Phil, aka "PeerGum", is a French Computer Engineer born in 1968 in a tiny city in the east of France,
called &Eacute;pinal, famous for its XIX's lithographs by Jean-Charles Pellerin
(Read more about &Eacute;pinal [a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinal' target=_blank]here[/a]).
After spending most of his teenage years in &Eacute;pinal, Philippe moves to Paris to study maths and physics and
consecutively learns engineering at ESIGELEC in Rouen, Normandy. Graduating in 1992, he then
comes back to Paris to specialize in Information Systems at ESCP.

[h5]The Traveling Engineer[/h5]
<p>Philippe starts his career in 1994 as a Network Administrator at CEGEDIM, close to Paris, and
decides to move to Sophia-Antipolis, a technological pole close to Nice on the French Riviera,
in 1997 to work for SITA/Equant, a worldwide company handling all network infrastructure for
the airports and big customers with a worldwide presence. In 1999, he moves to Atlanta,
Georgia, in the USA, to supervise the local Network Management team. After 6 years in
Operations, Philippe moves in 2000, to Engineering, still at Equant, now in Montr&eacute;al,
Qu&eacute;bec, Canada.

[h5]Brazil & the Solo Years[/h5]
<p>In 2001, his path moves to a solo career, in Brazil, where Philippe plans for several
projects in various domains - Book Print, Video Edition, Railroad Modelism - until he feels
ready for the big jump and founds Skloogs Consulting, a small business focused on IT
consulting and e-commerce, with his wife Anya. Unfortunately, this first business attempt
appears not as successful as expected and they decide to close the company.

[h5]Music Is On[/h5]
<p>At the end of 2010, after several years of self-employed computer services to individuals and websites
development and maintenance, Philippe starts spending some time on music composition:
[b]PeerGum[/b] is born. After completing his first album, [i]The Traveler[/i], and looking
for ways to distribute his music and make fans, Philippe discovers various sites providing
services to artists. Most of them offer great tools to help the artist producing works and
CDs, and even distribute them at online stores, but still it doesn't really brings the fans
at the artists reach.

[h5]MusXpand[/h5]
<p>This short experience in the Music Business motivates Philippe to create and develop a brand
new concept that will bring artists and fans together. So, on the 28th of September 2010,
he starts developing a new site based on his ideas, with the support of a few artists and
fans who accept to beta-test his project: the MusXpand story begins...
