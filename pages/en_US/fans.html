Welcome to MusXpand's Fans World!

We know you've already been a fan of various artists and bands, long before MusXpand existed
yet here you'll just discover a great new way to show your fanship to your favorite bands and
artists worldwide.

Most artists usually expect two things from their fan base:
<ul><li>Love</li>
<li>Support</li></ul>

Most people usually provide artists with a lot of admiration, sometimes even adoration,
with emulation and there is nothing more rewarding for an artist than a fan who just know
his or her songs by heart, sing them or just promotes the music with friends.

Nevertheless, for the last 10 years fans have shown a different kind of support. Because of
the ever changing fashion in music - helped by the Majors and their multi-millionnaire promotions -
fans have started to just copy and forward the music, still liking the artists and bands, but
not sustaining anymore the artistic production. Sales have fallen dramatically and the hope of
making a living from one's music is now sounding like old story.

How can this situation be reverted? Thanks to what we call True Fanship at MusXpand. What is
True Fanship? Simply a way to approximate the fans and the artists, through reciprocal
benefits. That is: fans get the most for their money, and artists can live from that
money and produce more. The virtuous circle "less money => less music => less fans => less money..."
then reverts to "more fans => more money => more music => more fans..."

So, at MusXpand, we decided to thank the fans a special way, making a distinction between:
<ul><li>The Likers &rarr; People who like to hear some bands and/or artists</li>
<li>The True Fans &rarr; People who help financially by subscribing to artists</li>
<li>The Believers &rarr; People who become a fan "forever"</li></ul>

All is not simply a question of money, yet rather a question of trust, as you will see...
