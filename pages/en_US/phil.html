{aboutpic:phil,Philippe Hilger}
Philippe is a graduate Electrical Engineering from ESIGELEC (Rouen/1992), and also possesses
a Specialized Master in Information Systems (Paris/1993)
and an Executive MBA (Rio/2005). He spent his early career as a
System, Network and Security Engineer in telecommunication companies, working in both Operations
and Engineering Department successively as a Team Leader and Project Manager. He launched his
first own business, Skloogs, in Rio de Janeiro, in 2006. Skloogs was based on e-commerce technologies
and was offering more than 8,000 products from computers to TV's and technology gadgets.
Despite its more than 10,000 visits/month, the business was closed in 2009 for economical reasons.

As an amateur artist, Philippe started then to focus on music development and discovered
the Music Business was stagnating and hardly accessible to the majority of artists worldwide.
So he decided to take this opportunity and create some innovation in the Music Business.
MusXpand's concept was born, and Philippe started developing it in September 2010.
After moving to Canada as a permanent resident in January 2011, he officially started the
MusXpand company in March.</p></div>
